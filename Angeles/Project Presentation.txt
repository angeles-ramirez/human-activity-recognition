----------------- 1. The Scoping Phase

1.1 product need - problem or challenge being analyzed

1.2 initial solution ideation
- rough sketches of solutions
-- unsupervised clustering vs boosted-tree-based classification vs probabilistic inference
-- data to be used (external data source or monitored and saved data)
-- data exploration

1.3 Data Prep and accesibility
- dumping large data sets from production into their staging/exploration
counterparts -- needed for research phase to start

1.4 Scope & KPIs
"predicting Activity recognition accuracy will reach 90% or higher
after adding 10,000+ data points"


scope limitation 1: only using one ml model
scope limitation 2: 


1.5. Scope & KPIs approval

---------------- 2. The Research Phase
- data set has been acquired
- additional data sources may be added

Exploration vs. Exploitation:

Exploration - where we gather more information that 
might lead us to better decisions in the future

Exploitation: -where we make the best decision given current information


2.2. Literature & solutions review
- balance between exploration and exploitation, and between diving 
into the intricacies of the material and extracting takeaways 
and possible uses quickly
